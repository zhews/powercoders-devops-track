## What is a System Admin?

- IT Professional
- Installation
- Maintenance
- Troubleshooting

<aside class="notes">
    So what are system adminstrators? Sysadmins are IT professional that take
    care of installation of servers. When there are existing devices Sysadmins
    take care of the maintenance. They make sure that the devices keep running
    and prepare usual updates. In case problems occur they do troubleshooting to
    get rid of them. To achieve these topics knowledge in many different topics
    is required. Lets take a look at them.

## Common Topics

---

## Operating Systems Management

- Mostly Linux sometimes Windows
- Installation
- Updates

<aside class="notes">
    Sysadmins need knowledge on how to manage operating systems. This in most of
    the times involves Linux as it is the most used operating system for
    servers. According to some sources around 90% of worlds top servers use
    Linux so it is definetly quite known. In some cases you will still have to
    work with Windows servers. You should know how to install your kind of
    operating system and as soon as it is installed know how to perform updates
    and security patches.

## Package Management

- Installing and Updating Dependencies
- Version Control

<aside class="notes">
    With package management we ensure that dependencies get installed, updated
    or removed efficently and organised. Through package management we can also
    make sure that two different systems use the same version of a dependency
    and through that not break applications.

## Server Management

- Set Up Services and Applications
- Monitoring
- Security Hardening
- Backups

<aside class="notes">
    Sysadmins do have to know how they can set up different kinds of services
    that other computers or application depend on. The same goes for
    applications, they should know how to install and maintain them. In both
    cases they will have to make sure monitoring is in place to catch errors
    early. Another thing that is important is the fact that the Sysadmin knows
    how to increase the security of the system. This includes closing unused
    ports, regular security patches, configuring firewalls, taking backups and
    so on. In case one day something goes wrong Sysadmins should know how they
    can restore backups they have previously taken.

## Scripting

- Automate Repetitive and Routine Tasks
- Time Saving
- Reduce Manual Errors

<aside class="notes">
    Scripts can automate repetetive and routine tasks. They help to safe time as
    they prevent you from typing each command manually. Another drawback to
    typing commands manually is making errors or typos. Scripting prevents that
    as well. In case Sysadmins have to interact with multiple devices (which
    they normally do) scripts make sure that things are consisten across all the
    devices.

## Troubleshooting

- Identify Problems
- Use Diagnostic Tools
- Use Metrics, Traces and Logs
- Document Systems
- Rollbacks

<aside class="notes">
    As a sysadmin you will also know how to do troubleshooting. This includes
    identifying the problems by using diagnostic tools and slowly isolation
    components that are not affected to find the actual cause. To identify the
    problems you should know your way around in metrics, traces and logs of
    applications. Another important aspect is documenting problems that have
    occured so that in case something similar happens other sysadmins can take a
    look into the documentation. In case things went fatally wrong or an update
    caused an issue you should know how to do rollbacks.

## Permission Management

- Users, Groups and Roles
- File and Directory Permissions
- Principle of Least Privilege

<aside class="notes">
    It is important for sysadmins to be able to secure systems. To do that you
    will have to know how to create users, groups and roles and how to then
    assign file and directory permissions. One thing that you should keep in
    mind is the principle of least privilege. This principle says that someone
    should only have permissions to specific resources which help them perform
    the tasks that have been assigned to them.

## Network Management

- Configure Interfaces
- Monitor Traffic
- Security Hardening

<aside class="notes">
    Another important thing is network management. Sysadmins should know how
    they can configure the interfaces required on the server. In case there are
    problems they should also know how to troubleshoot and diagnose network
    specific things. Another important aspect is monitoring the traffic making
    sure the network is performing as expected and healthy. As previously
    quickly mentioned configuring firewall rules, intrusion protection, VPNs and
    other things related to network is also part of a sysadmins life.
